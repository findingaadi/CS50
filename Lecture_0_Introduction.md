# Introduction

This was the first day of CS50 class, and the initial lecture was an introduction to computing from the base up.

- Just to remember when i come back here for revision, these are the bullet points.
- Unary is single digit. Binary means what can represent two digits i.e., 1 or 0.
- bit is 0 or 1, remember the bulb example.
- those bulb concept here is in computer transisters, i.e., it passes electricity, 0 being off and 1 being on. There are million such transisters in a computer system we have today.
- Patterns of 8 bits represent a byte and a pattern of bytes is the base of a computer system.
- ASCII chart can be used to map alphabets starting from 64 in decimal. It also got other symbols.
